## Best Practices for Strong Passwords

- Use at least 12-16 characters.
- Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.
- Avoid dictionary words or personal information.
- Consider passphrases (e.g., "Blue!Sky2025@Work").

## Common Password Attacks

- **Brute Force**: Attempts all combinations thwarted by length and complexity.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses precompiled word lists; defeated by unique, random passwords.

## Impact of Password Complexity on Security

- Complexity (length, variety) exponentially increases the time required for attacks.
- A 12-character random password can take years to crack via brute force, while a 6-character one might take hours.

## Tips Learned

- Regularly update passwords.
- Use a unique password for each account.
- Consider password managers for secure storage.
